Hey Guys!

Glad to have you here!

My name is Mathieu Frenette. I'm 42 years old and I live in the beautiful (and currently *pretty cold*) city of Montreal, in the province of Quebec, Canada.

My full-time job is as a software architect at LVL Studio, where I design the architecture of our video streaming solution for developing apps like those of Netflix.

But, in my secret life, I've always been totally fascinated by leadership and personal growth. Things like hidden super-powers that we all have within ourselves and that can change our lives !

Many years back, I got a diploma in hypnotherapy, I learned how to work with our subconscious to achieve incredible positive effects. And, let me tell you that, it really changed how I perceived the human mind !

Also, just last year, I decided to try something. I started to read more books. Like… a lot! Paper books, audio books, e-books. Mostly books about how to unlock our potential. And that… well… it transformed me even more!

A few months later, I decided to host weekly leadership workshops at LVL with a few colleagues and it was an amazing experience! And, just a few weeks ago, I decided it was finally time for me to go wild and share my findings, my thoughts, my experiments with the entire world (well, starting with you!)

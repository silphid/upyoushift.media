**You have a dream. You know where you want to be, but not necessarily where to start? You're passionate, curious and feel ready to take your life to the next level?**

**Then join me at Up You Shift!**

Hey guys! I'm so happy and excited to be here with you!

My name is Mathieu Frenette (or if you prefer, Matthew Frenet). I'm 42 years old and I live in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It's a beautiful and vibrant city, yet still *pretty cold* at this time of the year.

I work as a software architect at LVL Studio, where I design the architecture for video streaming apps, with cloud micro-services, artificial intelligence and stuff. I love my work, I have great colleagues…

But, let me tell you something… I also have a secret life! One in which I try to grow super powers and develop special abilities… I mean, *really* weird stuff, like:

* better health, morale and energy
* having extra time for myself, for my projects and personal growth
* a sharper mind with boundless creativity and vivid memory
* a peaceful and uncluttered mental... living… and working space
* having more initiative, influence and leadership
* being happier and enjoying life, just like when I was a kid
* having the courage to learn totally new things and stepping out of my comfort zone
